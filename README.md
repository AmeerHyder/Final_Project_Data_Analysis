# Data Analysis for Electrical Vehicle data

Now a days world is going towards Electrical Vehicles because of fossil fuels is constantly decreasing.Buying an electric vehicle can be a great choice for consumers. The drive quality, low noise levels, and convenience are really great. In the United States, one year of driving a petrol car can cost from 1500 USD to 2500 USD. On the other hand, the driving cost of Electric Vehicles is 500 USD. Electric cars are more preferable. The maintenance cost of electric vehicles is also very low. They are economical to maintain. The energy conversion efficiency of electric vehicles is also high. Electric vehicles use 60-70% of electrical energy. On the other hand, vehicles based on internal combustion engines have an efficiency of 18-22% only.

We will analyze some data related to various popular electric vehicles available in the European Market.The data consists of 180 vehicles and there are some missing values as well. We can conduct various data analytics visualizations to understand the data and information. This gives us an idea about the market as a whole and overall data distribution.

There for, I used different libraries to perform this task. such as Pandas, Statistics, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn to Analysis and Visualization of data.
